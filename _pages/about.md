Hi, my name is William, I am a physicist specialised in nanosciences and hydrogen storage. Indeed, two different fields that might have little in common, but in this age of change in paradigm can actually help in the development of new energy solutions. 

This is currently my day job. By night, I love tinkering with computers, electronics and code. A selection of projects is exhibited on this website, you can also find my CV with all the expected professional and academic experience. 

Don't hesitate to give me a shout if you want to talk.

# Currently

My day job is as a reasearch scientist in a small french startup specilised in the solid stat storage of hydrogen in metal alloys. Beyond the kinetics and thermodynamics knowledge in this field, I'm also involved in the fabrication of different apparetus in order to industrialise our processes.
