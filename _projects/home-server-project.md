The aim of this project is to setup a home server system for cheap. I decided to use Raspberry Pi computers for this, as I had a few laying around. 

The purpose of this was first to have a NAS (network attached storage), running [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/){:target="_blank"}, not only for simple back ups, but also to easliy share files without the need to rely on cloud services. 

One of the main feature I needed was to be able to reach the server when outside of my home. For this, [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/) {:target="_blank"} was the best option, again running on the home server.

Furthermore, I wanted to install [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/){:target="_blank"} to block adverts and trackers, as well as [Gitea](https://gitea.io/){:target="_blank"} to manage my projects, [OctoPi](https://octopi.org/){:target="_blank"} to control my 3D printer. 


## Hardware 

### Raspberry Pi
The raspi is a cheap and compact computer that can be used for home automation. It runs linux and thus can be used for many applications. The cherry on the cake is the fact that it is quite cheap with a a full computer for under 100â‚¬.
